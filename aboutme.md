title: About MACSS
subtitle: Why MACSS is the cosmology school you want to attend 
---

The main goal of this school is to prepare the
next generation of students, postdocs, and
researchers to perform statistical analysis over
cosmological observations using data from the present
large scale surveys like DESI and VERA
RUBIN C. OBSERVATORY, and future ones. 

The first part of each day will be devoted to lectures
and tutorials providing the basis of the advanced
topics. The rest of the day will be dedicated to
hands-on sessions for developing projects. A set of
projects will be predefined.

### My story

MACSS schools started in 2016 where three young researchers, with help from more Senior ones,  
created a space where the main goal was to delve into advanced statistical analysis
over cosmological observations, such as
large scale surveys like BOSS and
future (at that time) as DESI, LSST, SCI-HI, TolTEC, etc.

Now  we are already well into the stage IV large scale surveys and the Artificial Intelligence era, 
so the goal has not changed, but some of the topics have. More on the different editions soon...
