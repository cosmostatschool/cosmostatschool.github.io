subtitle: Why MACSS is the cosmology school you want to attend 
---
MACSS schools started in 2016 where three young researchers 
created a space where the main goal was to prepare the next
generation of students, postdocs, and
researchers to perform statistical analysis
over cosmological observations, such as
large scale surveys like BOSS and
future (at that time) as DESI, LSST, SCI-HI, TolTEC, etc.

Now  we are already well into the 
stage IV large scale surveys  and the Artificial Intelligence era, so the goal has not changed, but some of the topics have. 

The first part of each day will be devoted to
lectures and tutorials providing the basis
generating cosmological simulations. The rest
of the day will be dedicated to hands-on
sessions for developing projects.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
