The main goal of this school is to prepare the next generation of students, postdocs, and researchers to perform statistical analysis over cosmological observations using data from the present large scale surveys like DESI and VERA RUBIN C. OBSERVATORY, and future ones.

The first part of each day will be devoted to lectures and tutorials providing the basis of the advanced topics. The rest of the day will be dedicated to hands-on sessions for developing projects. A set of projects will be predefined.
